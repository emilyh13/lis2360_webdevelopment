              <h1>Women Taking Over the Coding World</h1>

              <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
              <p> Technology is today's future. The world of tehcnology is evolving around us. The main componet of technology is coding. Coding is the language of the computers. It is how us as humans tell the computers how we want to develop our websites, apps and softwares for others to use. Without coding there would be no technology and without technology what would become of our world?  </p>
              <p> Women are accomplisging more and more as time progresses. According to the C-net Tech Industry, "Women now make up more than half of new computer science graduates and junior developers entering the workforce". Women still have a lower percentage in the coding and programming workfield but it is quickly rising. Through out time women have made huge contributions to the coding world and are continuing to do so.</p>
              <p> When we think of programming and coding the first thing that comes to most people's mind is that it is a man's job. There has been a huge gender gap and women are fianlly getting the chance to change that. Sometimes many women feel very intimidated by coding and programming jobs because of the amount of men in the industry. They may feel like they are not good enough or smart enough. This is finally coming to an end, it is the 21st century, and women are finally understanding that they can do whatever they set their mind to.</p>
              <p> There are even new ways that women can get into coding and programming at a younger age. Many women and young girls don't know where to start when it comes to coding. Thanks to a passionate coder and full time model, Karlie Kloss fell in love with coding and wanted more women to have the chance to do so too. She created a solarship with New York computing school to help young women learn code and even donated 20,000 dollars to it herself. People all over the world are helping women succeed in this "male driven" workforce. But when a woman puts her mind to something anything is possible.</p>
